* We introduce 🪄**Lumos**, Language Agents with **Unified** Formats, **Modular** Design, and **Open-Source** LLMs. **Lumos** unifies a suite of complex interactive tasks and achieves competitive performance with GPT-4/3.5-based and larger open-source agents.
* 🧩 **Modular Architecture**:
  - **Lumos** consists planning, grounding, and execution modules built based on open LLMs such as LLAMA-2.
* 🌍 **Diverse Training Data**:
  - **Lumos** is trained with ~40K high-quality annotations from ground-truth reasoning steps in existing benchmarks with GPT-4. 
* 🚀 **Competitive Performance**:
  - 🚀 **Lumos** outperforms **GPT-4/3.5-based** agents on complex QA and web agent tasks, and larger open agents on maths tasks.
  - 🚀 **Lumos** performs better than open agent baseline formulations including **chain-of-thoughts** and **unmodularized** training.
  - 🚀 **Lumos** surpasses larger open LLM agents and domain-specific agents on an unseen task, WebShop.
